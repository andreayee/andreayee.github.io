         Hi. My name is Kyle Brueggemann and I am from Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. I just graduated from high school last year and I am currently a freshman here at NYU Shanghai. At home, mac and cheese was my number one comfort food, and I find myself missing it alot. So because it's so hard to find in China, I’m going to make it here in the dorms!

      When I was little I literally never ate anything except mac and cheese. The best kind was velveeta shells and cheese and I would ask my mom to make it for me for lunch every single day. She would always complain that I only ever ate mac and cheese but she knew I loved it so she would still make it for me.

          As I grew up I learned to not eat mac and cheese every single day, for the sake of my health, but it is definitely still one of my absolute favorite foods in the world. Even though it's such a simple recipe, it's so hard to find the right ingredients in China so this is going to be quite the experience.

          Being my first time living abroad, and my first semester in college, I feel that I’m adjusting pretty well, but that doesn’t mean that I miss home sometimes, so I’m excited to be able to share this recipe with you guys.
