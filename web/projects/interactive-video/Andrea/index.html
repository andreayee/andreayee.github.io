          My mom doesn't typically express love and affection verbally. Growing up, I don’t think I’ve ever heard an “I love you” or an “I miss you”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I often heard “sihk jó faahn meih a”–have you eaten yet? It was her home-cooked meals that represent her care for me. There were never any frozen TV dinners at home. My mom, who worked a full-time job with a two-hour commute, would come home and cook a full meal for the family.

          Growing up, I didn’t understand how tiring that must have been. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In first grade, I remember there was a day when my mom wasn't able to pack me her usual home-cooked lunch kept warm in a thermos. My first grade vocabulary described that day's cold lunch as "two pieces of bread". Even though my teacher laughed and explained that the two pieces of bread were in fact a sandwich, I still felt crushed.

          This wasn't the type of food my mom normally made, and as a result, I thought she didn't care for me anymore. Little did I know, my mom was probably just too tired or busy from the night before. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, I really appreciate the time my mom put in to make sure I was always fed.

         It’s now my third year in university. I’ve been away from home for quite a while now. Transitioning hasn't been too tough. The SF Bay Area and NYC both have a high Asian-American population, making me feel more at home. 
         </p>
         <p>
         However, as ironic as it may seem, I feel completely out of place in China. I’ve been missing home lately, so that’s why I’m making my mom’s fried rice. With rice, eggs, and spam, it’s a quick and easy-to-make comfort food. 
       </p>
       <p>
        It's perfect for those days when I get home late and I'm pressed for time, just like mom had been in several ocassions.
