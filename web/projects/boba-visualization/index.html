					Boba. Bubble tea. Pearl milk tea. 珍珠奶茶 (zhēnzhū nǎichá). Traditionally speaking, it’s a tea-based beverage invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. Made of a black, green or oolong tea base with milk and an optional helping of sugar and a good shaking to best combine the flavors, the drink is a cool (or hot, if that’s more your style), refreshing and, in our opinion, more fun alternative to coffee thanks to the plethora of toppings you can add. Boba’s most iconic topping is, well, boba: chewy, black tapioca balls that are first boiled then soaked in either a honey or brown sugar solution for added flavor. Other popular toppings include mini boba, grass jelly, red bean, egg pudding, rainbow jelly and salted cheese, to name a few. 
				</p>
				<p class="fade">
					What makes the milk tea base so unique is that you can customize it with flavors, including (but not limited to) Yakult (a Japanese yogurt drink popularized by Netflix’s To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before), taro, honey, chocolate, Okinawa (brown sugar) and more fruity flavors like strawberry, mango and litchi. If tea isn’t your thing, no worries –– fruit-flavored slushes are also offered at many bubble tea shops, making bubble tea –– and we use this term very loosely, given all it can encompass –– a drink for all seasons. But how did this delicious and versatile alternative to coffee and all-around lifestyle for some first come about?

				<p class="fade">
					Though there’s still a lot of speculation as to who came up with the delicious and frothy beverage, most credit Liu Han-Chieh and Lin Hsiu Hui of Chun Shui Tang teashop in Taichung, Taiwan with the invention of bubble tea. In the early 1980s, Liu Han-Chieh first got the idea of serving Chinese tea cold after a visit to Japan brought to his attention how the Japanese served coffee cold. In 1988, Chun Shui Tang experimented by adding a sweetened Taiwanese tapioca pudding into her iced Assam tea and once she introduced it to the menu, it quickly outsold all the shop’s other iced teas. 

				</p>
				<p class="fade"> 
					As word of the new drink spread, it caught on with other teashops that started using fruit powders and syrups (as a cheaper and more durable alternative to fruit) for added flavor and expanding their available toppings to include grass jelly, almond jelly, egg pudding, red bean and more. Finally, many shops switched from milk to non-dairy creamer or milk powder for their longer shelf-life. The tea and milk were then shaken together to give the drink a frothy and creamy consistency, as well as the name “bubble” tea for the bubbles that surfaced after the drink was mixed.
				</p>
				<p class="fade">

					Since its creation, bubble tea has been a massive part of Taiwanese culture, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that Taiwanese immigration to the US and growing cafe culture led to a bubble tea craze in America. Growing up, my generation frequented shops like Quickly, Tapioca Express and more regional options for a quick drink or a weekend pick-me-up with a side of popcorn chicken. The bubble tea craze started dying down in the 2000s only to be revived with the opening of Boba Guys, which offered high-quality teas, laid-back atmosphere and real milk. Since then, bubble tea culture has seen a resurgence all over the world, especially where diasporic Asian communities reside, and have become an iconic symbol of Asian culture.

					Hi! We’re Andrea and Alex, two students at NYU. For a web design class, our final project was supposed to be Internet art, but we wanted to do something a little different. Since we’ve been studying in Shanghai, our boba habits have gone a bit haywire since it’s readily available pretty much everywhere we go or through ele.me, a delivery app, and it’s much cheaper than in the US. 
				</p>
				<p class="fade">
					After seeing Krist Wongsuphasawat’s “Boba Science,” which visualizes the optimized sip of bubble tea such that you can finish your tea and boba at the same time, we wanted to know more about other people’s boba buying and drinking habits so we created a Google form to assess where in the world people are from, where they went to university if at all, their age, how often they get boba, where they get boba, and how they customize their drink. Moreover, we wanted to take all that information and present it in a fun and engaging way. 
				</p>
				<p class="fade">
					Special thanks to Subtle Asian Traits for making up the bulk of our survey pool and for providing some entertaining and much needed information, like what your boba order says about you or just how many boba shops there are all over the world (and how they rank against each other).

					Thanks so much for much for visiting our site, and have a bobalicious day!
