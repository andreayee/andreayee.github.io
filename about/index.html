			<h4>Hi! Iâ€™m currently a junior studying media, culture, and communication at NYU.</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>
					As a member of NYU Steinhardt's Global Media Scholars, I've studied in both Paris and Shanghai. Since attending NYU, I've lived in six cities across the globe and traveled to ten countries. Through this experience, I've broadened my worldview and have developed a newfound passion for cultural exchange.

				<li>
					When I'm not traveling, I'm usually busy staring a computer screen and wondering why my code breaks. Beyond the classroom, I love hiking and working on landscape photography
					
				</li>
				<li>
					I also tend to spend too much time in the kitchen trying new recipes. I have a love-hate relationship with baking. I may be slightly food obsessed. My favorite dates include trips to Trader Joe's and to the Union Square Farmer's Market.
					
				</li>

				<li>
					My roommate has declared me a gym rat. I swear, I'm not though. However, my denial might just add fuel to her claims.
